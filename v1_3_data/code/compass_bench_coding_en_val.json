        "instruction": "Write a python program that implements data storage oriented blockchain that rewards node owners who host data. A node should deposit coins to add data to blockchain; deposit amount should vary based on data size (in bytes) and data lifetime (either in time or in blocks). The deposited amount should be distributed evenly across all nodes hosting that data until it's lifetime is expired. One can increase their data storage deposit to extend storage time. A node should take fees from other nodes for accessing its stored data. A node can \"delete\" their data from blockchain; after that other nodes are not rewarded for storing the data anymore and the original data uploader gets their unused data storage deposit back.",
