Present the results in a structured table with the following columns: `Test Name`, `Result`, `Normal Range`, `Interpretation`. You can make up plausible tests and results.\n\n8. **Images and Scans:** Include an H2 header \"Images and Scans,\" where you will embed links to dummy images using the markdown format `![Image Description](image_url)`. Create a list of common scans performed for autoimmune disorders and construct appropriate markdown links indicating that no real image data is available.\n\n9. **Lab Interpretations:** Under the H2 header \"Lab Interpretations,\" provide an in-depth analysis of the test results. Invent plausible interpretations of lab findings for an autoimmune disorder.\n\n10. **Provisional Diagnosis:** Create an H2 header for \"Provisional Diagnosis,\" and use an ordered list to suggest possible conditions that could explain the patient's symptoms and lab results.\n\n11. **Recommendations:** The H2 header \"Recommendations\" should include an ordered list of further tests, referral to a specialist, or treatment strategies.\n\n12. **Conclusion:** Under the H2 heading \"Conclusion,\" summarize the report in a brief paragraph.\n\n13. **Formatting:** \n    - Use bold text for each section header.\n    - Introduce a horizontal rule (`---`) after the title and conclusion sections.\n    - The content within the sections should maintain standard readable markdown text.\n    - Use italics for emphasis when necessary, particularly for medical terminology that may not be commonly known.\n\n14. **References:** Provide a list of fictitious references under an H2 header \"References,\" formatted using markdown lists.\n\nRemember that you are allowed to create and improvise on details not explicitly provided in these instructions, while making sure they are consistent with common autoimmune disorder presentations and diagnostics.",
